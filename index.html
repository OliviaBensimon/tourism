      <p>TK Lede in with something specific about tourism being the main drive of the city&rsquo;s economy; ways it feels alive</p>

      <p>Last month, Mayor Bill de Blasio presented his $98.6 billion &ldquo;Recovery Budget&rdquo; for the Fiscal Year 2022, the largest budget in the city&rsquo;s history, with its aim to drive the city&rsquo;s comeback after being decimated by the
        pandemic. &ldquo;With the Recovery Budget, New York City will emerge from this challenge stronger, fairer, cleaner, greener and safer than ever,&rdquo; <a
          href=&rdquo;https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/307-21/the-recovery-budget-mayor-de-blasio-releases-executive-budget-fiscal-year-2022&rdquo;> he announced on April 26th</a>.</p>

      <p>The budget outlines various sectors it would invest in to support New York City&rsquo;s &ldquo;comeback&rdquo; by investing in working families and <a
          href=&rdquo;https://commercialobserver.com/2021/04/de-blasio-promises-street-improvements-small-biz-funding-tourism-in-98-6b-budget/&rdquo;> driving the city&rsquo;s economic growth</a>. TK Line summarizing the importance of tourism and
        sustainable city from Center for Urban Futures De Blasio proposed $25 million to &ldquo;launch Largest Tourism Campaign in History with NYC&amp;Co,&rdquo; over $12 million to expand Open Streets and outdoor dining, and $7 million to expand
        bike lanes.</p>

      <p>In its <a href=&rdquo;https://coalition.nycgo.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/NYCCompany_Roadmap_for_Tourism_Reimagining_and_Recovery.pdf&rdquo;> 2020 annual report</a>, NYC &amp; Company &ndash; a <a
          href=&rdquo;https://business.nycgo.com/about-us/who-we-are/&rdquo;>quasi-agency/private company tasked with marketing the city to tourists</a> &ndash; asserted that the way to bring back tourists to New York City was to start by engaging
        with New Yorkers and show them what the city has to offer.</p>

      <p>&ldquo;Our initial focus on hyperlocal is extremely important because, as we learned following the financial crisis of 2008, getting New Yorkers to spend in their city through staycations and other promotions was a key part of our
        success,&rdquo; the report says. &ldquo;Simply put: Once New Yorkers actively engage with their city again, so too will the nation and the world.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>If Twitter was ever an indicator&#8230; New Yorkers are engaging with the various ways the city has opened up its roads to its residents. People want to <a href=&rdquo;https://twitter.com/Julcuba/status/1388642432166907904?s=20&rdquo;> get
          married on the Open Street on Vanderbilt Ave </a> in Prospect Heights. Between April and November 2020, <a href=&rdquo;https://nyc.streetsblog.org/2020/12/07/cycling-is-up-car-trips-are-down-de-blasio-is-confused/ &rdquo;>more than double
          the number of New Yorkers were crossing the East River bridges by bike </a> compared to the same period in 2019.</p>

              <h3>Bikes</h3>
              <p> As the city was reopening last summer, more New Yorkers took to the streets by bike. Transportation Alternatives, a nonprofit organization that advocates giving back the streets to the people, reported that more than double the
                number of bikers had crossed the East River bridges by bike. In a <a href=”https://nyc25x25.org/”>report released earlier this year</a>, TA argues that if the city repurposed 25% of car space, future city leaders could create acres
                worth of public space which could “stimulate spending, attract and retain residents and jobs, and encourage tourism.”

              <h3>Ferries</h3>
              <p>Predictably, as the city shut down last year, ferry ridership in the city dropped. Between April and June 2020, usually peak ridership during warmer months, Bloomberg <a
                  href=”https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-09-25/nyc-ferry-s-hornblower-faces-cash-crunch-after-a-lost-summer?sref=rFDs9bRF”> reported an average of 6,177 passengers on an average weekend day </a> compared to 27,000 riders
                during the same period in 2019. But in February, THE CITY <a href=”https://www.thecity.nyc/transportation/2021/2/4/22267583/nyc-ferry-de-blasio-financial-boost”> reported that the Economic Development Corporation had agreed to
                  increase its support of the ferry systems </a> to $64 billion. This year, NYC Ferry is set to expand services to Coney Island and to the West Side – the hope is to encourage more people to use the ferry to make those long distance
                trips. </p>

            <div class="inner">
              <h3>Walking</h3>
              <p>In late April 2021, City Council approved making Open Streets a permanent program in New York City. In a Siena College Research Institute poll <a href=”https://nyc25x25.org/”>commissioned by Transportation Alternatives</a>, 63% of
                registered New York City voters polled
                supported expanding the Open Streets program. Currently, the city has 67 miles of Open Streets, and the hope is to add more. The TA report argues that with more pedestrian space, tourists will patronize local businesses. Who doesn’t
                love drinking a cocktail in the middle of a revamped roadway? </p>

              <h3>Outdoor Performances</h3>
              <p>As Jane Jacobs writes in The Life and Death of Great American Cities, “The ballet of the good city sidewalk never repeats itself from place to place, and in any one place is always replete with new improvisations.” Since last spring,
                city streets, parks, and empty parking lots <a href=”https://www.timeout.com/newyork/news/how-nycs-streets-became-its-most-coveted-stages-050521>have turned into stages</a> for performers to sing, act, dance, and New Yorkers are
                loving it. The city has already launched various initiatives to help struggling artists, like <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/08/arts/music/andrew-cuomo-nypopsup-concerts.html”>“NY PopsUp” </a> and the <a
                  href=”https://www1.nyc.gov/site/cecm/cultural-events/guidelines.page”>Open Culture Program </a> which allows artists of all sorts perform on designated Open Streets. With Broadway only set to reopen in September, most of the summer
                <a href=”https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/16/theater/summer-outdoor-performances.html”>performances will keep taking place outdoors </a>.
